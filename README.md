# Dungeons and Dragons Loot Generator

Dungeons and Dragons small pythonic loot generators based on Player's Handbook.

From 2018 and 2020 I ran a twice-monthly Dunegons and Dragons campaign for friends. I developed these loot generators to simplify the process of creating randomized loot and was long considering turning it into a web-app.
